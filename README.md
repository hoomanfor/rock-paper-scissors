This web app is a multi-player 'Rock Paper Scissors' game. To play, each player must visit the game using their own computing device. Decide if you'd like to be Player 1 or Player 2 by entering your name. Once a competitor joins and enters their name, gameplay can begin. There's a scoreboard to track wins, losses, and ties. Additionally, if you enter your name, you will be able to use the 'Messenger' to chat with your opponent. 

This web app relies on Firebase's Realtime Database to persist data. The data is deleted when both players close the web browser tab used to visit the game. Good luck, and I hope you have fun!
